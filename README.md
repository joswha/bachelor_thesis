# Evaluating Existing Security Tools For Android Applications

### automatoor.py

Automates running the following tools:

1. apkid
2. apkleaks
3. dependency-check
4. flowdroid
5. mobsf

> Disclaimer: You need to have these tools installed before you can actually run the script. 


Outputs are then saved in the following format:

`{tool_name}_output/{app_name}` for every tool and apps there are.

The apps/ folder is available via this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xi8mVjELfh2cudOWJOpU-pFbQBxOzlxr?usp=sharing).
