This improves performance on many devices, but slows down some.\n- Show FPS: When checked, shows frames drawn per second in the upper left.\n\nVector Pinball is open source; the code is at https://github.com/dozingcat/Vector-Pinball\n\nThanks to Mario at www.badlogicgames.com for code improvements and libgdx.\n\nsound, music, & audio code, by pdx\nTwittering Machine\nhttp://www.twittering.com\"", "(JJ)V", "\"preferences_button_label\" : \"Pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences\"", "\"show_fps_pref_title\" : \"Montrer les FPS\""], "firebase_urls": [], "files": ["META-INF/MANIFEST.MF", "META-INF/798AD563.SF", "META-INF/798AD563.RSA", "META-INF/buildserverid", "META-INF/fdroidserverid", "AndroidManifest.xml", "assets/audio/bumper/dinga1.ogg", "assets/audio/bumper/dingc1.ogg", "assets/audio/bumper/dingc2.ogg", "assets/audio/bumper/dingd1.ogg", "assets/audio/bumper/dinge1.ogg", "assets/audio/bumper/dingg1.ogg", "assets/audio/misc/andBounce2.ogg", "assets/audio/misc/ball1.ogg", "assets/audio/misc/flipper1.ogg", "assets/audio/misc/message2.ogg", "assets/audio/misc/rolloverE.ogg", "assets/audio/misc/startup1.ogg", "assets/tables/table1.json", "assets/tables/table2.json", "assets/tables/table3.json", "assets/tables/table4.json", "assets/tables/table5.json", "res/drawable-hdpi-v4/icon.png", "res/drawable-mdpi-v4/icon.png", "res/drawable-xhdpi-v4/icon.png", "res/drawable-xxhdpi-v4/icon.png", "res/drawable-xxxhdpi-v4/icon.png", "res/layout/about.xml", "res/layout/main.xml", "res/raw/androidpad.ogg", "res/raw/drumbassloop.ogg", "res/xml/preferences.xml", "res/xml/preferences_nomultitouch.xml", "resources.arsc", "classes.dex", "com/badlogic/gdx/physics/box2d.gwt.xml", "com/badlogic/gdx.gwt.xml", "com/badlogic/gdx/graphics/g3d/particles/particles.fragment.glsl", "com/badlogic/gdx/graphics/g3d/particles/particles.vertex.glsl", "com/badlogic/gdx/graphics/g3d/shaders/default.fragment.glsl", "com/badlogic/gdx/graphics/g3d/shaders/default.vertex.glsl", "com/badlogic/gdx/graphics/g3d/shaders/depth.fragment.glsl", "com/badlogic/gdx/graphics/g3d/shaders/depth.vertex.glsl", "com/badlogic/gdx/utils/arial-15.fnt", "com/badlogic/gdx/utils/arial-15.png", "lib/armeabi/libgdx-box2d.so", "lib/x86/libgdx-box2d.so", "lib/arm64-v8a/libgdx-box2d.so", "lib/armeabi-v7a/libgdx-box2d.so", "lib/x86_64/libgdx-box2d.so"], "exported_count": {"exported_activities": 0, "exported_services": 0, "exported_receivers": 0, "exported_providers": 0}, "apkid": {"classes.dex": {"compiler": ["dx (possible dexmerge)"], "manipulator": ["dexmerge"]}}, "quark": [], "trackers": {"detected_trackers": 0, "total_trackers": 428, "trackers": []}, "playstore_details": {"error": true}, "secrets": [], "average_cvss": null, "appsec": {"high": [{"title": "Application vulnerable to Janus Vulnerability", "description": "Application is signed with v1 signature scheme, making it vulnerable to Janus vulnerability on Android 5.0-8.0, if signed only with v1 signature scheme.
